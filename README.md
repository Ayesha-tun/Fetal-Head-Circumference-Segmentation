### Fetal-Head-Circumference-Segmentation
Ultrasound imaging is frequently used to pregnant women as a regular check-up for monitoring fetal development and early diagnosis of any abnormalities. Gestational age is generally used to understand the duration of pregnancy and give us vital information about the fetus growth. Fetal head circumference, a biometric parameter plays major role in computing gestational age. The manual segmentation of fetal circumference from ultrasound images obtained by sonographers requires intensive training and experience and may cause stress injury. A convolutional neural network has been proposed here using U-Net which aims to detect the fetal skull from 2D ultrasound images. U-Net was utilized addressing its limitations in the aspect of selecting a suitable loss function, optimal learning rate for optimizer and overfitting. After several experimentations, a new combination of focal Tversky, dice loss and binary cross-entropy has been proposed as the improved loss function and a learning rate 2e-3 for Adam optimization has been chosen and data augmentation was done. The proposed method was able to properly segment the head circumference without any gap and superimposition of train image and segmented image was done to validate this. The model is evaluated with the original U-Net and it is seen that the proposed model performs better than original U-Net.
